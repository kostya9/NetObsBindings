# NetObsBindings

[![NuGet version (NetObsBindings)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/NetObsBindings.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetObsBindings/)

NetObsBindings is a library that provides .NET bindings for Open Broadcaster Software (OBS).

These bindings are generated from the OBS repository, specifically [libobs](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/tree/master/libobs) and [obs-frontend](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/tree/master/UI/obs-frontend-api) projects.

The approach taken is to generate a static class per header file via [ClangSharp](https://github.com/dotnet/ClangSharp) generator.
This means, that, for example, you could find functions exported from the [obs-service.h](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/libobs/obs-service.h) file in the [ObsService](https://github.com/kostya9/NetObsBindings/blob/main/NetObsBindings/ObsInterop/ObsService.cs) C# class.

## How to use these bindings?

These bindings can be used to create your own plugin in C#. There is one caveat: make sure you are publishing the plugins as NativeAOT libraries, this is essential to make it work due to the plugin model of OBS.

Examples:
- samples folder contains a [simple plugin example](https://github.com/kostya9/NetObsBindings/blob/main/samples/SimplePlugin/ObsPlugin.cs).
- more comprehensive example - [ObsCSharpExample](https://github.com/YorVeX/ObsCSharpExample) by [@YorVeX](https://github.com/YorVeX)
    > Example for an OBS plugin written in C# containing various standard items like output, filter, source or a settings dialog in the OBS Tools menu.


Plugins made using this library:
- [xObsBrowserAutoRefresh](https://github.com/YorVeX/xObsBrowserAutoRefresh) by [@YorVeX](https://github.com/YorVeX)
    > OBS plugin providing a filter for automatically refreshing a browser source in a configurable interval.

## How to generate bindings locally?

In order to generate bindings locally, please use the [build.ps1](https://github.com/kostya9/NetObsBindings/blob/main/build.ps1) script. Make sure that you have ClangSharpPInvokeGenerator dotnet tool installed.

This script will:
1. Clone the OBS repository
2. Generate bindings for all required modules
3. Insert the version of the OBS library to [Obs.Version.cs](https://github.com/kostya9/NetObsBindings/blob/main/NetObsBindings/Obs.Version.cs) file.

NB: to change the OBS version - modify the $GitTag variable in the ./init_obs.ps1 script. Also please update the package version to indicate the OBS version that it is generated from.
E.g. 30.0.2.0 means that the bindings were generated from the OBS version 30.0.2.
